## Plot
 
Rocky is a hot-tempered man who lives in Mumbai with his parents. He often gets into fights against injustice. One day he gets into a fight with a man who works for Anthony, a dangerous criminal, and beats him up. Anthony warns him not to cross paths with him. One day while Rocky is with his girlfriend Neha, he sends Anthony's brother to the hospital. When Anthony finds out, he confronts Rocky and Neha and kills Neha. He mocks at Rocky and escapes. An angered Rocky loses control of himself, making his family turn him away. Anthony threatens Rocky's family to leave Mumbai. The family along with Rocky eventually moves to London.
 
There Rocky tries to forget his past life. His father lies to him that Anthony has been sentenced to death by the court. Three months later, Rocky's friend Vikram visits them and informs them that Anthony has escaped the trial by killing both the eyewitnesses. Meanwhile, Priya, a tour guide and Rocky's friend, is harassed by some people. When she shouts to Rocky for help, he unlike before, takes a conservative path and walks away. Vikram tells Priya the truth about Rocky's past and why he has changed.
 
On hearing this Rocky feels shattered and wants revenge. He travels back to India along with his parents. Anthony learns that Rocky has returned to Mumbai. He then pays a visit to his home where he encounters Rocky's father. His father tells him to meet Rocky at the same spot where he had killed Neha several months ago.
