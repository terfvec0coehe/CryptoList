# How to Use Renault Immo Code Calculator II to Generate Transponder Data
 
If you have lost your Renault key or need to make a replacement, you may need to use a Renault Immo Code Calculator II (CCR2) to generate transponder data for your car. This software can calculate immobiliser codes for most Renault models from 1997 to 2002, using the EEPROM data from the immobiliser module or the UCH processor. Here are the steps to use CCR2:

1. Download and install CCR2 from [this link](https://www.codecard.eu/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=34). You will need to pay â¬80.00 (without VAT) to get the software.
2. Connect a transponder read/write tool to your computer. You can use Silca RW2 or a similar device.
3. Remove the immobiliser module or the UCH from your car. You can find the location of these parts in your car manual or online.
4. Open the module or the UCH and locate the EEPROM chip. It is usually a small black square with 8 pins on each side.
5. Use a programmer device to read the EEPROM data and save it as a file on your computer. You can use Xprog-M, UPA-USB or a similar device.
6. Run CCR2 and select the model and type of your car from the drop-down menu.
7. Load the EEPROM file into CCR2 and click on "Calculate". The software will generate 16 bytes of transponder data and display it on the screen.
8. Write the transponder data into a blank PCF7931 transponder using your transponder read/write tool.
9. Insert the transponder into your key shell and test it on your car. It should start the engine without any problem.

Congratulations! You have successfully used CCR2 to generate transponder data for your Renault key. If you have any questions or problems, you can contact [andrius@codecard.eu](mailto:andrius@codecard.eu) for support.

Here are some additional paragraphs for the article:
 
CCR2 can also generate 12-digit key learning codes for new Laguna II and Megane/Scenic II models. These codes are required to program new keys using a diagnostic tool. To calculate these codes, you need to read the EEPROM data from the UCH processor (MC68HC912DG128/256) and load it into CCR2. The software will display the 12-digit code on the screen. You can then enter this code into your diagnostic tool and follow the instructions to program new keys.
 
CCR2 supports more than 10 types of immobiliser modules and processors from different Renault models. You can find the list of supported types in the CCR2 manual or on the website. If you have a type that is not supported by CCR2, you can contact [andrius@codecard.eu](mailto:andrius@codecard.eu) and request a custom solution. The developer may be able to add support for your type in the future updates of CCR2.
 
CCR2 is a reliable and easy-to-use software that can help you solve many Renault immobiliser problems. It is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10 operating systems. It requires an internet connection to activate and update. You can download the latest version of CCR2 from [this link](https://www.codecard.eu/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=34).
